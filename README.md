# OpenJio - CS203 Collaborative Software Development Project

This repository contains the source code for the OpenJio web application. OpenJio is a powerful and user-friendly events website tailored for university students, designed to enhance the way you discover, create, and participate in events on your campus.

## Features

1. **Central Hub to Discover New Events** The Central Hub feature serves as a vibrant digital marketplace where users can effortlessly explore a diverse array of events. Users can filter events based on their interests, location, or date, ensuring that they never miss out on activities that align with their preferences. With intuitive search functionalities and real-time updates, this feature keeps users informed about the latest happenings on and around their campus or community.

2. **Seamless Event Registration and Personalised Queue System** This feature simplifies the event participation process by offering seamless registration options. Users can easily sign up for events they're interested in, by autofilling their details. Additionally, we incorporated a personalized queue system depending on the type of event such as FCFS and Demographic-based.

3. **Event Creation for University Clubs and Societies** Empowering university clubs and societies, this feature provides a user-friendly platform to create and manage events. Club organizers can easily set up event details, including date, time, venue, and description. They can also specify registration requirements and capacity limits.
