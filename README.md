## Features

1. **Central Hub to Discover New Events** The Central Hub feature serves as a vibrant digital marketplace where users can effortlessly explore a diverse array of events. Users can filter events based on their interests, location, or date, ensuring that they never miss out on activities that align with their preferences. With intuitive search functionalities and real-time updates, this feature keeps users informed about the latest happenings on and around their campus or community.

2. **Seamless Event Registration and Personalised Queue System** This feature simplifies the event participation process by offering seamless registration options.

Club organizers can easily set up event details, including date, time, venue, and description. They can also specify registration requirements and capacity limits.
